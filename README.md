# Othello-project
In this project, we will explore the game-playing of Othello using search algorithms and
 heuristics. Othello is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board, where each
 player has pieces that are either black or white. The goal of the game is to have the
 most pieces of your color on the board at the end of the game.
