# Othello-project
In this project, we will explore the game-playing of Othello using search algorithms and
 heuristics. Othello is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board, where each
 player has pieces that are either black or white. The goal of the game is to have the
 most pieces of your color on the board at the end of the game. 
# Game Playing Algorithms
 1. The minimax algorithm: a basic search algorithm that examines all possible moves from
 a given position and selects the move that leads to the best outcome for the current
 player
 2. Alpha-beta pruning: an improvement on the minimax algorithm that can reduce the
 number of nodes that need to be searched.
 3. Alpha-beta pruning with iterative deepening (depth is increased iteratively in the search
 tree until the timing constraints are violated)
# Heuristics
 Use at least one of the below or a combination of all of them. Refer to the paper here to learn
 how those heuristics are calculated.
 1. Mobility
 2. Coin Parity
 3. Corners Captured
 4. Stability
# The GUI
 You will need to create a GUI that allows for human vs. human, human vs. computer,
 and computer vs. computer gameplay.
 # Simulation
